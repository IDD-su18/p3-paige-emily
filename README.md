# P3: first prototypes
## List of Questions
1. What features will work best in classifying our sensor readings?
2. How reliable/ accurate will condenser microphones be when measuring the difference between fractured and non-fractured bones? 
3. How much will noise affect our device's accuracy? 
4. What is the best method for sensing and actuating the bone? How do we collect that data (bluetooth, phone aux jack, microSD)?
5. How can we design our device's hardware such that we...
   - reduce the amount of pain the patient feels,
   - make the process intuitive,
   - and improve the accuracy of sensing?

## Look and Feel Prototype
We imagine the full interaction for our prototype to go as follows:
1. Doctor opens the device's app, and plugs the sensor into the headphone jack
2. Doctor positions the sensor and actuator on opposite ends of the suspected fracture point
3. Doctor presses a button on the actuator, which sends a sound through the bone. The sensor will record this, and the GUI will update accordingly
4. (optional) Doctor can save these results to the patient's log, to be used for monitoring. The log will track the patient's healing over time.

## Reflection
During this assignment, we learned that OpenSCAD files are tough to work with, pre-soldered wires never last, and carrying a pig femur around daily is not fun.
